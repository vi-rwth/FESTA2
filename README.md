To the finished and published version: https://github.com/vi-rwth/FESTA.git \
To the publication: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01022

Main differences:
- Histogram creation from COLVAR possible (not PLUMED exclusive anymore)
- Pre-sorting of trajectory and therefore significant speed increase
- Now also compatible with MLIPs (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0155887) CFG-format
- TODO: Only output unique structures

This is purely experimental and highly work-in-progress
